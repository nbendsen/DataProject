<hr />
<p>This page includes a comparison between diversity measures computed using the abundance data and the beta binomial cover data. Further more it includes two examples of applications of the beta binomial update function presented at the <a href="Model.html">Bayesian model</a> page. The page should, hopefully, give the reader a further feeling of how the beta binomial cover update function works as well as give inspiration to what cases the function can be used for.</p>
<p>The <em>Comparison</em> page will use data for the tertiary habitat “Nardus grasslands” to study the effect of the beta binomial cover update function on the data viewed through different diversity measure. We will furthermore use the tertiary habitat “Dry calcareous grasslands” to also look at the effect of the beta binomial cover update function at site level as opposed to plot level as we only did in the first example, but for this part we will use. This will primarily be done by visual inspections.</p>
<p>The <em>Species diversity and pH value page</em> works with the tertiary habitat “Nardus grasslands”. This example will include a small study of the relation between pH value of the soil and species diversity calculated using either the abundance data (in this case cover data) or the beta binomial cover data.</p>
<p>The <em>Species diversity and nitrogen deposition</em> page works with the tertiary habitat “Dry calcareous grasslands”. This tertiary habitat is included to study the effect of nitrogen deposition on species diversity.</p>
<p>Yoy can read more about what kind of data that is used at the <a href="Introduction.html">Introduction</a> page.</p>
<div id="examples" class="section level2 tabset">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<div id="comparison" class="section level3">
<h3>Comparison</h3>
<p>In the the first part of this page we will only work with a subset of the NOVANA data including the tertiary habitat “Nardus grasslands” (in the NOVANA dataset this is encoded as terhabtype = 6230). Furthermore, we only look at year 2014. Further details on how this subset was created, can be found at <a href="data_6230.html">data 6230</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cover &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/cover_data_6230_year2014.csv&quot;)
freq &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/frekvens_data_6230_year2014.csv&quot;)
abiotiske &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/abiotiske_data_6230_year2014.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In the obove the freq dataset, is the present/absence dataset, and will be refered to as freq data trough the example.</p>
<p>We apply the beta_binomial_cover_update function to the cover and freq datasets and obtain a dataset with updated abundace values for each species in each plot. In the following we will refer to this as the beta binomial cover data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>beta_binomial_cover &lt;- beta_binomial_cover_update(cover, freq, n = 16, 3)</code></pre>
<p>If you want to get a futher look at how the functions works on this type of data you can go to the <a href="Model.html">Bayesian model</a> page.</p>
<h3>
Species level
</h3>
<p>The following plot is included as an example of a prior distribution used in the beta binomial update method. The plot is the prior distribution for the species “Agrostis capillaris”</p>
<pre class="r"><code>curve(dbeta(x,a,b), xlab = &quot;relative cover&quot;, main = &quot;Prior distribution of Agrostis capillaris&quot;, ylab = sprintf(&quot;Beta(%.3f, %.3f)&quot;, a, b))</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The above plot was built as follows: for each plot where the species “Agrostis capillaris” had a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in the presence/absence data we saved the number of pins the species was hit by in the cover data and divided these by 16 to get the relative cover. We then fitted a beta distribution to these numbers and thereby obtained the plot.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is seen that there is a high probability of being either around 0 or around 1. This is not only for this species but a common beta prior distribution for many species. This is because a lot of species are grouped in a way, such that if they are present, they will cover a lot of the area, or else they are not present at all.</p>
<h3>
Hill Diversity comparison
</h3>
<p>In this section we will use the Hill diversity that is described in <a href="Diversity.html">Diversity</a> to compare the beta binomial cover data with the observed cover data. This will highlight how using the beta binomial update method will change the result, depending on how much emphasize rare species are given when calculating the diversity for a plot.</p>
<p></br></p>
<p>Hill diversity is given as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Hill diversity = }\left( \sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i (r_i)^{l}\right)^{1/l}
\]</span></p>
<p>where the <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> exponent determines how much weight rare species is given. For high <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> values the Hill diversity is more sensitive to rare species. For <span class="math inline">\(l = -1\)</span> we have the Hill Simpson diversity, for <span class="math inline">\(l = 0\)</span> we have the Hill Shannon diversity and for <span class="math inline">\(l = 1\)</span> we have the species richness. In the below we look at some plots in the dataset. We see how the diversity of the plot changes as a function of the exponent <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. We do this for the plot in the observed cover dataset (red line) and for the same plot in the beta binomial cover data (blue line). This can help to give a feeling of when the beta binomial update method, has the biggest inpact on the computed diversity measures.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>For plot 1</p>
<pre class="r"><code>different_diversities(cover, beta_binomial_cover, plot = 1,  remove_column = 3)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>For plot 100</p>
<pre class="r"><code>different_diversities(cover, beta_binomial_cover, plot = 100, remove_column = 3)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>It should be noted that in practice we would not calculate the species richness for a plot with the observed cover data but rather with the presence/absence data. If we did calculate the species richness from the observed cover data, we would only get the species richness of the small square in the center of the plot and not of the entire plot, since the specie richness is a count of the number of species present in a plot. In the above plot we want to show how the observed cover data and the beta binomial cover data compare. Therefore, we have calculated the species richness from the observed cover data (species richness is <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> = 1). Of this reason, one should probably be careful and not interpret too much on the diversity estimates for large values of <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> for the observed cover data as these diversity estimates are not comparable with the ones we get from the beta binomial cover data.</p>
<p>When we apply the beta binomial update method all species observed in the presence/absence data of the plot will get added a small value in the beta binomial cover data even though they have a <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> in the observed cover data. When we add this small abundance to species that did not have any observed abundance in the observed cover data we get a higher diversity estimate as expected.</p>
<p>In both the observed cover data and the beta binomial cover data the diversity estimates increase as <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> increases. However, the diversity estimate for the beta binomial cover data increases at a much more rapid pace. This can be contributed to the fact that as <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> increases the diversity estimate gets more sensitive towards rare species, and thereby favor rare species more.</p>
<p>All the species that had a <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> in the observed cover data will have a be assigned a small abundance value in the beta binomial cover data, if they have a “1” in the present/absence data, implying that these species are rare in this dataset. Thus, the beta binomial cover data will have a lot more rare species than the observed cover data and it, therefore, makes sense that as <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> increases, the difference in diversity estimates from the beta binomial cover data and the observed cover data increases.</p>
<p>Instead of only looking at a single plot at a time, we plot the average curve for all plots. The shaded area around the curve visualize the standard deviation at any point along the curve. We do it for all plots in the observed cover data and all the plots in the beta binomial cover data.</p>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Many of the same comments as before also apply to this plot. We note the standard deviation stays roughly the same and only gets bigger for values of <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> close to 1. However, as stated earlier we would not use cover data to estimate species richness but presence/absence data so we are not too worried about the increased deviation in this part of the plot.</p>
<h3>
Different diversity estimates compared
</h3>
<p>This subsection is intended to further study what the effect of the beta binomial cover update function is on the data. For a number of different diversity measures we will plot the diversity measure obtained from the beta binomial cover data against the diversity measure obtained from the observed cover data. This is meant to further visualize the effect of the proposed method.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All the used diversity estimates are defined at the <a href="Diversity.html">Diversity</a> page. When the Shannon index, Hill Shannon and Hill Simpson are calculated using the beta binomial cover dataset they will be referred to as “beta binomial Shannon index”, “beta binomial Hill Shannon” and “beta binomial Hill Simpson” respectivly.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Below we have calculated the shannon index for each plot in both the observed cover dataset and in the beta binomial cover updated dataset and plotted these against each other</p>
<pre class="r"><code>observed_shannon &lt;- shannon(cover, 3)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>beta_binomial_shannon &lt;- shannon(beta_binomial_cover, 3)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>It can be seen in this example that the beta binomial Shannon indexes give a slightly higher value for all plots. Noticeably are the biggest difference among plots with a low Shannon index.</p>
<p>As stated ealier many species grow in lumbs, so for the plots with a low Shannon index, is it not unlikely that the small square is placed around a few species, hence do not cover the species that is growing in the plot but outside of the square. Therfore they are not accounted for in the cover data, but do get assigned a small value in the bete binomial cover data. When this is the case, it makes sence, that the Shannon index, changes a lot, because the all of the species not present in the small square, is now taking into account.</p>
<p><br><br> We make a similar plot with the Hill Shannon diversity.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>observed_hill_shannon &lt;- hill_shannon(cover, 3)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>beta_binomial_hill_shannon &lt;- hill_shannon(beta_binomial_cover, 3)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Here can it be seen that the difference seems to be largest with the higher value of the Hill Shannon.</p>
<p><br> Another method to estimate species diversity is to use the Hill Simpson diversity. We create a similar plot as above.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>observed_hill_simpson &lt;- hill_simpson(cover, 3)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>beta_binomial_simpson &lt;- hill_simpson(beta_binomial_cover, 3)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The difference between the beta binomial Hill Simpson diversity and the Hill Simpson diversity obtained from the observed cover data is less than than for the Hill Shannon as expected. This fits nicely with what we found in the “Hill Diversity comparison” subsection. It is worth to notice that we in this plot get some diversity estimates that are lower in the beta binomial cover data than in the observed cover data.</p>
<h2>
Comparisons across sites
</h2>
<p>In this second part of the page we will look at the tertiary habitat “dry calcarous grasslands” (in the NOVANA dataset this is encoded as terhabtype = 6210) from year 2009. This subset is made in the same way as the subset at <a href="data_6230.html">data 6230</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cover_6210 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/cover_data_6210_year2009.csv&quot;)
freq_6210 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/frekvens_data_6210_year2009.csv&quot;)
abiotiske_6210 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/abiotiske_data_6210_year2009.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We apply our function to the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>beta_binomial_cover &lt;- beta_binomial_cover_update(cover_6210, freq_6210, n = 16, remove_column = 3)</code></pre>
<p>Again we refer to this new dataset as the beta binomial cover data.</p>
<p>So far we have just been comparing the effect of the beta binomial cover update function at a plot level. Since each plot is just a sample of a larger site, it could interesting to see the effect of the beta binomial cover update function at a site level instead.</p>
<p>We will do this by aggregating the data for all the plots from the same site. We will use the Hill Shannon diversity to measure the species diversity as this estimator does not favor neither common or rare species.</p>
<p>We will first plot how beta binomial Hill Shannon compares with the observed Hill Shannon, where we for each site has taken the average value for all plots within that site.</p>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This looks quite similar to what we found when we compared at plot level.</p>
<p>Another comparison we can make is to look at how the variance of species diversity changes for a site when we apply the beta binomial cover update function and use the Hill Shannon diversity as a measure.</p>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The above suggest that for the sites with a large variance in Hill Shannon diversity, the variance become larger when the beta binomial cover update function is applied as opposed to the observed cover data. For sites with a low variance the change does not seem to be as big.</p>
</div>
<div id="species-diversity-and-ph-value" class="section level3">
<h3>Species diversity and pH value</h3>
<p>In the this example we only work with a subset of the NOVANA data including the tertiary habitat “Nardus grasslands” (in the NOVANA dataset this is encoded as terhabtype = 6230). Furthermore, we only look at year 2014. Further details on how this subset was created, can be found at <a href="data_6230.html">data 6230</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cover &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/cover_data_6230_year2014.csv&quot;)
freq &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/frekvens_data_6230_year2014.csv&quot;)
abiotiske &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/abiotiske_data_6230_year2014.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In the obove the freq dataset, is the present/absence dataset, and will be refered to as freq data trough the example.</p>
<p>We apply the beta_binomial_cover_update function to the cover and freq datasets and obtain a dataset with updated abundace values for each species in each plot. In the following we will refer to this as the beta binomial cover data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>beta_binomial_cover &lt;- beta_binomial_cover_update(cover, freq, n = 16, 3)</code></pre>
<p>One of the reasons one might want to calculate the diversity for a plot or a site is to compare how different variables affect the diversity of the site. An example of this could be that one wants to see how the pH value of the soil are related to the diversity of the plot. The pH value is associated with plants nutrient availability and lots of other stuff. Thus, we might be able to see a change in the diversity for changing pH values. The pH values are additionally of concern due to acidification from precipitation which may alter pH in the soil.</p>
<p>We calculate the Shannon index using fist by cover data and then by using the beta binomial cover data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>observed_shannon &lt;- shannon(cover, 3)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>beta_binomial_shannon &lt;- shannon(beta_binomial_cover, 3)</code></pre>
<p>Below we plot the beta binomial Shannon index and the observed Shannon index against the pH value of the soil. This is intended to visualize partly if there seems to be any interesting relationship between Shannon index and pH value of the soil and also whether the use of the beta binomial cover update function changes this conclusion.</p>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There does not seem to be any clear relationship between the Shannon index and the pH value. As we also saw in the “Different diversity estimates compared” subsection, the plots with low observed Shannon index get a slightly higher Shannon index when this is calculated from beta binomial cover data.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We study the relationship between species diversity and pH value of the soil a bit further. The function <a href="gradient_plot.html">plot_idiversity</a> is used to visualize how different ways of calculating diversities compare against each other when mapped against the pH values of the soil. From the left we have species richness, Hill Shannon and Hill Simpson, thus, we get less sensitive to rare species.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_diversity(data_for_plot ,c(&quot;Species richness&quot;, &quot;Beta binomial Hill Shannon&quot;, &quot;Beta binomial Hill Simpson&quot;), &quot;pH&quot;, description = &quot;The PH value of the soil for each plot&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The general trend that can be seen for all three diversities, beta binomial Hill Shannon, beta binomial Hill Simpson and Spices Richness, is that a low pH value is correlated with lower diversity up until a certain point. Further analysis will be needed to understand whether or not this is a casual relationship.</p>

<h3>Species diversity and nitrogen deposition</h3>
<p>In the second example we look at the tertiary habitat “dry calcarous grasslands” (in the NOVANA dataset this is encoded as terhabtype = 6210) from year 2009. This subset is made in the same way as the subset at <a href="data_6230.html">data 6230</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cover_6210 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/cover_data_6210_year2009.csv&quot;)
freq_6210 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/frekvens_data_6210_year2009.csv&quot;)
abiotiske_6210 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/abiotiske_data_6210_year2009.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>With this data we are especially interested in how the diversity change when plotted against different values of nitrogen deposition (from atmosphere). This is especially relevant for nature areas close to farm lands. It is assumed that if the value of nitrogen deposition is high, there is a lot of nitrogen in the soil. Increased nitrogen alters competetion and is often associated with species loss (due to increasing dominance of few competetively strong plant species).</p>
<p><br> Therefore, some illustrations of the relationship between nitrogen deposition and diversity measures can be used as another example of where the beta binomial cover update function can be used. <br><br> We apply our function to the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>beta_binomial_cover &lt;- beta_binomial_cover_update(cover_6210, freq_6210, n = 16, remove_column = 3)</code></pre>
<p>Again we refer to this new dataset as the beta binomial cover data.</p>
<p>Again we start with the Shannon index as this is so often used to estimate species diversity. We plot the observed Shannon index and the beta binomial Shannon index against the nitrogen deposition.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>observed_shannon &lt;- shannon(cover_6210, 3)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>As it can be seen here is there not a big difference between the two plots. It should however be noticed that the beta binomial Shannon index is slightly higher for all values of nitrogen deposition. It might also be important for an analysis to notice that fewer plots have a Shannon index at 0 for the beta binomial model. Both plots show a slight downwards trend indicating that higher nitrogen deposition might lead to lower diversity.</p>
<p>The plots below illustrate how some other diversity measures applied to the beta binomial cover data looks like when mapped against the nitrogen deposition</p>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-46-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><img src="figure/example.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-47-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There does not seem to be a clear relation between the nitrogen deposition and the diversity for any of the diversity measures.</p>
