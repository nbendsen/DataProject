Species diversity is an important measure that can be used to describe the state of a nature area. Often, species diversity is estimated based on either a presence/absence dataset from a larger area or an abundance dataset, e.g. cover data from a smaller area. In this vignette we propose a new method with the goal to combine the information from an abundance dataset with the information from a presence/absence dataset. The idea of combining both types of data is that they contain different information about species within a nature area, hence some information will be lost if only one type of data is used. We will be working with a subset of the [NOVANA](https://novana.au.dk) dataset to illustrate how this new method can be applied.



Here the reader can gain an overview of the pages included in the vignette:

* **[Introduction](Introduction.html)**
  * The page will give a further introduction to the problem and an introduction to the NOVANA dataset. 
* **[Bayesian model](Model.html)**
  * The page contains a description of the theory used to develop the model and a small introduction of how to use the model. 
* **[Diversity](Diversity.html)**
  * The page will give an overview of the different ways to estimate diversity.
* **[Functions](Function_usage.html)**
  * The page gives an overview of the functions used, what they take as input, what they give as output and how they can be used on an example dataset.
* **[Examples](example.html)**
  * Examples of applications of the Bayesian model using the NOVANA dataset. This will also include a comparison between using the developed method or only using observed abundance data for estimating species diversity. 
* **[Model validation](model_validering.html)**
  * The page shows how the developed method is performing compared to the observed abundance data when calculating diversity estimates. This is accomplished by using posterior predictive checks.

<h2>About us</h2>

The page has been build by Malthe Holst Pedersen, Nikolaj Bjerg Bendsen and Ditte LÃ¸nborg Mikkelsen. We are all studying Data Science at Aarhus University and as part of one of our courses we were assigned to a project about species diversity. Together with our supervisors we were able to narrow the problem down to finding a method for combining abundance data and presence/absence data to obtain more accurate estimates for species diversity.
To show our work we have made this vignette, so the reader is able to use the developed method.
