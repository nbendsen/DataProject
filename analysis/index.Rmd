Species diversity is an important measure that can be used to describe the state of a nature area, and a change in species diversity can be used to study if the state of an area is in progress or decline. Often, species diversity is estimated based on either a presence/absence dataset from a larger area or an abundance dataset, e.g. cover data from a smaller area. In this vignette we will propose a new method with the goal to combine the information from a cover dataset with the information from a presence/absence dataset. The idea of combining both datatypes is that they contain different information about species within a nature area, hence some information will be lost if only one type of data is used. Furthermore, we will be working with a subset of the [NOVANA](https://novana.au.dk/) dataset as examples to show how the new method can be applied.


An overview of the pages included in the vignette:

* **[Introduction](introduction.html)**
  * The page will give a further introduction to the problem and goal of this vignette as well as an introduction to the NOVANA dataset. 
* **[Diversity](Diversity.html)**
  * The page will give an overview of the different ways to estimate species diversity.
* **[Bayesian model](Model.html)**
  * The page contains a description of the theory used to develop the Bayesian model and also an implementation of the model in R.
* **[Functions](function_usage.html)**
  * The page gives an overview and presentaion of the functions used on the [Examples](example.html) page. This includes a small example for each function. 
* **[Examples](example.html)**
  * Examples of use cases for the Bayesian model using the NOVANA dataset
* **[Model validation](model_validering.html)**
  * The page introduces posterior predictive checks and use these these to study the performance of the Bayesian model with respect to the observed cover datasets.
