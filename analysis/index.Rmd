Species diversity is an important measure that can be used to describe the state of a nature area, and the change in the species diversity is used to inform about whether the state of an area is in growth or decline. Often, species diversity is estimated based on either a presence/absence dataset from a larger area or an abundance dataset, e.g. cover data from a smaller area. In this vignette we will propose a new method with the goal to combine the information from an abundance dataset with the information from a presence/absence dataset. The idea of combining both types of data is that they contain different information about species within a nature area, hence some information will be lost if only one type of data is used. We will be working with a subset of the [NOVANA](https://novana.au.dk) dataset to illustrate how this new method can be applied.



Here you can gain an overview of the pages included in the vignette:

* **[Introduction](introduction.html)**
  * The introduction page will give you a brief introduction of the data used and the method developed. 
* **[Diversity](Diversity.html)**
  * The Diversity page will give you an overview of the different diversity estimates, we have used as examples. 
* **[Bayesian model](Model.html)**
  * The Bayesian model page contains a description of the theory used to develop the model, and why we have chosen the distributions we have. 
* **[Examples](example.html)**
  * Examples of use cases for the Bayesian model and comparison between using the developed method or only using abundance data for estimating species diversity. 
* **[Model validation](model_validering.html)**
  * The Model Validation page shows how the developed method is performing compared to only using abundance data or present/absence data for calculating diversity estimates.  
* **[Functions](function_usage.html)**
  * The Functions page gives an overview of the functions used, what they take as input, what they give as result and how they perform on an example dataset.

<h2>About us</h2>

The page has been build by Malthe Holst Pedersen, Nikolaj Bjerg Bendsen and Ditte LÃ¸nborg Mikkelsen. We are all studying Data Science at Aarhus University and as part of one of our courses we were assigned to a project about species diversity. Together with our supervisor we were able to narrow the problem down to finding a method for combining abundance data and presence/absence data to obtain more accurate estimates for species diversity.
To show our work, we have made this vignette, so other people are able to use the developed method.
