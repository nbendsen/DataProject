This page will have a list of all our functions, together with a short description and guide in how to use them. It will also include a link for further documentation for each function.


<h1>Bayesian method</h1>
Implementatin of method described on main page.
**Usage:**

bayesian_method(cover_data, present/absence_data, n = 16 , remove_column = 0)

**Arguments:**

* **Cover_data**: Cover data in a data frame, with plots as rows and species as columns.
* **present/absence_data**:  present/absent data in a data frame, with plots as rows and species as columns. 1 for present and 0 for absent.
* **n**: If cover data is not between 0 and 1, what should it be divide with to be in the interval $[0,1]$.
* **remove_column**: Exclude first n column from the data analysis. In the NOVANA dataset this we would remove the first 3 columns as they include data about the plot, site and year.

**Output** The function returns a dataframe with updated abundance data.

<h1> Shannon index</h1>
------

The shannon index only uses cover data.

**Usage:**

row_shannon(cover_data ,species_indicator = NULL)

**Arguments:**

* **Cover_data**: A data frame with plots as rows and the cover data for each specie as columns.

* **species_indicator**: A string. Is used to specify which columns contain species data. It will use all columns which contain the string as a substring.  If left empty all columns in cover_data will be assumed to be for species.

**output:**

* A vector with the shannon index for each row, ordered with the first row as the first value.

<h1>Species_richness </h1>
------
Species richness is the number of observed species in a given plot.


**Usage:**

species_richness(frequency_data ,species_indicator = NULL)

**Arguments:**

* **frequency_data**: A data frame with plots as rows and the frequency data for each specie as columns (1 if the species is spotted, 0 if not).

* **species_indicator**: A string. Is used to specify which columns contain species data. It will use all columns which contain the string as a substring.  If left empty all columns in frequency_data will be assumed to be for species.

**output:**

* The function return a vector with the speciess richness for each plot, in the same order that the columns were in.

<h1>plot_index_gradient</h1>
------

A function to plot a variable against different diversity measures to see how they compare against each other.

**Usage:**

plot_index_gradient(data, indexes, gradient ,gradient_text = NULL)

**Arguments:**

* **data**: A data frame with the different indexes to be compared and the gradient to compare them against
* **indexes**: A list of the column names for the indexes as strings.
* **gradient**:The column name for the gradient as a string.
* **gradient_text**: A description of the gradient as a string.

**Output**

Four plot with different diversity measures plottet against a variable.

<h1>diversity_index</h1>
------

A function using abundance data to calculate a diversity index using:

$$
\text{Hill diversity = }\left( \sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i (r_i)^{l}\right)^{1/l}
$$

**Usage:**

diversity_index(abundance_data, remove_columns = 0, l = 1)

**Arguments:**

* **abundance_data**: Abundance data in a data frame, with plots as rows and species as columns.
* **remove_columns**: Exclude n column from the data analysis. i.e if the first 3 columns include data about the plot, and is not data about a species can they be excluded.
* **l**: A number that specifies l in the formula.

**Output**

A vector with the diversity for each row in the abundance data.
